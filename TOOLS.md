# TOOLS.md - Local Notes

Skills define _how_ tools work. This file is for _your_ specifics — the stuff that's unique to your setup.

## Defaults (use unless user overrides)

### Workflow
- **Batch missing info** into one prompt (form‑style).
- **Do‑unless‑blocked**: proceed by default; only stop for OTP/CAPTCHA/legal/personal‑data inputs or irreversible payments.
- **Single‑thread**: avoid context switching unless blocked.
- **Credential staging**: store and reuse credentials in Bitwarden.
- **Use brain-skills/** first for business/marketing tasks.
- **Browser default:** use the OpenClaw-managed browser profile and open tabs directly; only request Chrome extension relay when a specific existing tab is needed.
- **Bitwarden:** unlock session key lasts ~1 week; if unlocked, proceed without asking again during that window.
- **Unbrowse creator wallet:** always use GXtXwH2jEGryN5QoHeunx3ubYizDeju1EkZ2PvcPjh6a.

### Business / Website (placeholders until confirmed)
- **Business name:** RentToLive
- **Website name:** RentToLive
- **Preferred email format:** Proton (create new when needed)
- **Phone:** +27 82 222 7457
- **Address:** 32 Rosmead Avenue, Cape Town
- **Pricing default:** Micro‑services tiered $0.05–$0.50 (basic/standard/premium), anchor around $0.15–$0.35
- **Payment rail:** USDC on Base
- **Brand tone:** Modern, clean, direct, trustworthy; light technical edge

## Why Separate?

Skills are shared. Your setup is yours. Keeping them apart means you can update skills without losing your notes, and share skills without leaking your infrastructure.
